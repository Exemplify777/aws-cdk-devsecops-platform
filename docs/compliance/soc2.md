            'encryption_in_transit',
            'access_logging',
            'backup_enabled'
        ]
    
    def check_compliance(self):
        """Check SOC 2 compliance status."""
        results = {}
        for control in self.controls:
            results[control] = self.check_control(control)
        return results
```

## Evidence Collection

### Automated Evidence

The platform automatically collects evidence for SOC 2 compliance:

2. **Configuration Changes**: AWS Config for infrastructure changes
3. **Security Events**: GuardDuty findings and security alerts
4. **Performance Metrics**: CloudWatch metrics for availability
5. **Backup Records**: Automated backup completion logs

### Manual Evidence

Some evidence requires manual collection:

1. **Policy Documentation**: Security policies and procedures
2. **Training Records**: Security awareness training completion
3. **Risk Assessments**: Annual risk assessment reports
4. **Incident Reports**: Security incident documentation
5. **Vendor Assessments**: Third-party security evaluations

## Control Testing

### Automated Testing

```python
# Automated control testing
def test_soc2_controls():
    """Test SOC 2 controls automatically."""
    
    # Test CC1.1 - Password Policy
    assert check_password_policy_compliance()
    
    # Test CC2.1 - CloudTrail Logging
    assert check_cloudtrail_enabled()
    
    # Test CC6.1 - Encryption at Rest
    assert check_encryption_at_rest()
    
    # Test A1.1 - System Availability
    assert check_system_availability() >= 99.9
```

        # Implement strong password policy
        pass
    
    def remediate_mfa_compliance(self):
        """Remediate MFA compliance issues."""
        # Enable MFA for all users
        pass
    
    def remediate_encryption_issues(self):
